# Creating a pull request template for your repository

When you add a pull request template to your repository, project contributors will automatically see the template's contents in the pull request body.

For more information, see [About issue and pull request templates](/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates).

You can create a *PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE/* subdirectory in any of the supported folders to contain multiple pull request templates, and use the `template` query parameter to specify the template that will fill the pull request body. For more information, see [Using query parameters to create a pull request](/en/pull-requests/reference/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request).

You can create default pull request templates for your organization or personal account. For more information, see [Creating a default community health file](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

## Adding a pull request template

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2. Above the list of files, select the **Add file** <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-triangle-down" aria-label="The downwards-facing triangle icon" role="img"><path d="m4.427 7.427 3.396 3.396a.25.25 0 0 0 .354 0l3.396-3.396A.25.25 0 0 0 11.396 7H4.604a.25.25 0 0 0-.177.427Z"></path></svg> dropdown menu, then click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-label="plus" role="img"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg> Create new file**.

   Alternatively, you can click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-label="The plus sign icon" role="img"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg> in the file tree view on the left.

3. In the file name field:
   * To make your pull request template visible in the repository's root directory, name the pull request template `pull_request_template.md`.
   * To make your pull request template visible in the repository's `docs` directory, name the pull request template `docs/pull_request_template.md`.
   * To store your file in a hidden directory, name the pull request template `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
   * To create multiple pull request templates and use the `template` query parameter to specify a template to fill the pull request body, type *.github/PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE/*, then the name of your pull request template. For example, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md`. You can also store multiple pull request templates in a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` subdirectory within the root or `docs/` directories. For more information, see [Using query parameters to create a pull request](/en/pull-requests/reference/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request).

4. In the body of the new file, add your pull request template. This template could consist of asking to include:
   * A [reference to a related issue](/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#referencing-issues-and-pull-requests) in your repository.
   * A description of the changes proposed in the pull request.
   * [@mentions](/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) of the person or team responsible for reviewing proposed changes.

5. Click **Commit changes...**

6. In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see [Creating a commit with multiple authors or on behalf of an organization](/en/pull-requests/how-tos/commit-changes/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors).

7. Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see [Creating a pull request](/en/pull-requests/how-tos/create-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

   ![Screenshot of a GitHub pull request showing a radio button to commit directly to the main branch or to create a new branch. New branch is selected.](/assets/images/help/repository/choose-commit-branch.png) Templates are available to collaborators when they are merged into the repository's default branch.

8. Click **Commit changes** or **Propose changes**.
